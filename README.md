# Classic1Rebble
 Simple but attractive watchface for Rebble/Pebble.

Author: Charles Tatum II
Version: 1.0.0

This is a simple watchface using the LECO system font (part of the Rebble/Pebble platform) to display the time and date in the following
format:

Top line: HH:MM:SS
Middle line: Day of week
Bottom line: MM/DD/YY

This project may be used as a basis for creating other Rebble/Pebble watchface designs. The main source file includes explanatory notes
on the meaning of various symbols, as well as other helpful information.

The name of the watchface, as it appears on a Pebble timepiece, is "Classic1".
